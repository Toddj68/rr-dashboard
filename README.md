Go to GitHub.com and create a free account.

Create a new "Repository" named rr-dashboard.

Upload your Mobile-RR_Dashboard_V17.9-GOLD.html file and rename it to index.html.

Go to Settings > Pages and set the branch to main.

GitHub will give you a link (e.g., https://yourname.github.io/rr-dashboard/).

Open that link in Chrome on your phone. The "Install app" option will now be in the three-dot menu.

Method B: Use a "Web Server" App on your Phone
Download a free app called "Simple HTTP Server" from the Google Play Store.

Open the app and point it to the folder where your HTML file is saved.

The app will give you a local IP address (like http://192.168.1.5:8080).

Open that address in Chrome. Chrome treats "localhost" and local network IPs as secure enough to allow the "Add to Home Screen" option.

📋 Checklist for V17.9 Mobile
Once you successfully install it via one of the methods above:

Search and Find: Tapping FIND should now pop up the search results instantly.

Input Blur: After typing an RR#, tap the background of the app to "set" the number and update the display.

Standalone Mode: When launched from the home screen icon, the browser address bar should be gone, giving you more screen space.

Would you like me to help you set up the GitHub Pages link so you can easily send it to your other beta testers?
